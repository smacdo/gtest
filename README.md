# gtest
## Introduction
Google's unit testing library, mirrored from their subversion repository and
modified for easy inclusion into a new project.

## Usage
It should be really straight forward using this library. Simply create clone
this project, include it in your CMake build system and you are good to go.

(Example will be coming)

## Modifications
I've "slimmed" down the Google Test library by running fusing all the files into
gtest.h/gtest-all.cc. Additionally, the examples, unit tests and other build
files have been removed.
